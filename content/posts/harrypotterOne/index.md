Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly(非常的) normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in(卷入) anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with(赞同) such nonsense(胡言乱语、歪门邪道).

Mr Dursley was the director(主管) of a firm(公司) called Grunnings, which made drills(电机). He was a big, beefy(高大粗壮) man with hardly any neck, although he did hava a very large moustache(胡子). Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde(金发) and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning(伸长) over garden fences, spying on(偷窥) the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer(更好) boy anywhere.
